## 📎 About Me

### 🐋 Who I Am  
Hi, I’m Yoonji, a **front-end engineer** with a background in both `design` and `computer science`. I studied `Design Engineering`, a convergence major that blends technical and creative disciplines, allowing me to explore `programming`, `UI/UX`, and `human-computer interaction`.  


### 🖥️ How I Got Into Front-End Development  
I first discovered my love for **visual organization** through designing `PowerPoint slides` in high school. However, I wanted to create something **more dynamic, interactive, and accessible**, which led me to `web development`. I taught myself `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, later expanding into `React`, `Next.js`, and modern web frameworks.  

I gained hands-on experience through **internships and startup projects**, where I worked on an `big data visualization editor`, and an `synthetic visual data turing test platform`, and an `artist-fan connection platform`. These experiences solidified my passion for **building intuitive, interactive, and scalable applications**.  


### 💡 What I Create  
I thrive on building products that are **useful, meaningful, and beautiful**. Some of my key projects include:  
- **🐈‍⬛ Expense Tracker** – A budgeting app with a simple yet effective UI.  
- **☑️ Life Management Tool** – A comprehensive `task manager`, `scheduler`, and `journal` all in one.   
- **🔄 Real-time SNS App (Upcoming)** – A service integrating `task-sharing`, `music-sharing`, and `productivity features`.  

I love designing and developing services that not only function well but also **enhance people's daily lives**.  

### ⚓️ My Journey in Canada  
Currently, I’m enrolled in a `Web Application Development co-op program` in Canada, preparing to start my career as a **front-end engineer**. I chose Canada for its `opportunities`, `tech industry`, and the support of my family here.  

Beyond coding, I find joy in **art, music, and aesthetics**—I love **painting**, **playing bass**, and curating my surroundings with my favorite color, `blue`. Recently, I even **formed a band** here in Canada, making my journey even more fulfilling.  


### 🔭 What’s Next?  
I’m always eager to explore **new opportunities, learn new skills, and push the boundaries of what I can create**. My goal is to build products that seamlessly blend `design` and `technology` while continuously growing as a `front-end engineer`.  

If you share a passion for **creating beautiful, functional digital experiences**, let’s connect! 🎨💻🎶

## 🎬 My Motivation

As a front-end engineer, I believe that understanding JavaScript deeply is essential for writing **clean, efficient, and scalable code**. While I can build applications, I want to **gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding** of JavaScript’s core principles—things like `execution contexts`, `closures`, `event loops`, and `memory management`. 

I started **JS Dive Study** not only to **strengthen my own foundation** but also to create a structured learning environment where others facing similar challenges can **study together, share insights, and grow as developers**. By diving deep into JavaScript, I aim to write more **efficient, maintainable code** and tackle complex front-end problems with confidence.  



<br />

## 🔭 My Expectations

Through **JS Dive Study**, I want to **bridge the gap between theory and practice** by engaging in **in-depth discussions, hands-on exercises, and collaborative learning**. 

Rather than passively consuming content, I hope this study group becomes a place where members actively challenge themselves—**questioning, experimenting, and refining their understanding** of JavaScript. Additionally, I look forward to **sharing knowledge, exchanging perspectives, and learning from others** as we explore advanced concepts together. 

My ultimate goal is to **build a strong JavaScript foundation**, not just for myself, but for everyone involved, so we can all write **better, more scalable, and performant code**.
